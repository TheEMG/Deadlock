# Deadlock 
The DeadlockDetection program reads system resource states from text files and applies a deadlock
detection algorithm. It outputs the state of resources and identifies any deadlocked processes.
The program also outputs the allocation matrix, the request matrix, and the available resources vector.

# What I learned 
- This project helped me understand the concept of resource allocation, process request, and the conditions that lead to deadlock
- I gained practice on implementing and working with multi-dimensional arrays, such as the allocation and request matrices
- I also gained practice on file parsing and input handling.
